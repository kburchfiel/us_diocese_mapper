# US Diocese Mapper
This project shows how to use Python to create both interactive and static maps of Latin Rite Catholic dioceses, provinces, and cathedrals within the United States. 

The mapping script (along with additional documentation) can be found [here](https://github.com/kburchfiel/us_diocese_mapper/blob/master/us_diocese_mapper_V11.ipynb). (If you receive a message from GitHub saying that "the notebook took too long to render", you can also access a copy of the documentation in HTML format [here](https://kburchfiel.github.io/us_diocese_mapper/us_diocese_mapper_V11.html). 

The interactive diocese map can be found [here](https://kburchfiel.github.io/us_diocese_mapper/revised_diocese_map.html). Here are some examples of the interactive map in action:

The mapping script also generates static maps. Here's a tileless version of the map that also includes Alaska and Hawaii:

And here's a version of the map showing the lower 48 states with Stamen Toner tiles in the background:
