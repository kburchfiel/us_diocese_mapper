# US Diocese Mapper
This project shows how to use Python to create both interactive and static maps of Latin Rite Catholic dioceses, provinces, and cathedrals within the United States.

The interactive diocese map can be found [here](https://kburchfiel.github.io/us_diocese_mapper/revised_diocese_map.html). Here are some examples of the interactive map in action:

The mapping script also generates static maps. Here's a tileless version of the map that also includes Alaska and Hawaii:

And here's a version of the map showing the lower 48 states with Stamen Toner tiles in the background:
