Code released under the MIT License

(The county_shapes.csv, county_shapes.geojson, state_fips_codes.csv, and counties_by_diocese.csv files are released into in the public domain.)

The tileless maps (with a gray background) are released under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license (CC-BY 4.0); I believe the ones with the Stamen Toner background may need to be released under a more restrictive license since they display OpenStreetMap data in the background, but I'm not sure. I would like to release those under a CC-BY 4.0 license as well if possible.
